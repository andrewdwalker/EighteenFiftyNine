Your goal is to implement a simple engineering application to control 2 simple devices ( a simple "stage" and a simple led, both simulated for the purpose of the exercise).

This is relevant to the work we are currently doing.

 

Traditionally, the engineering application exposes  manual control for each device on the system as well as any calibration/testing/validation procedures we might need during instrument bring up / services.

 

Here is a set of requirements to be implemented:

User should be able to manually control each device thru a UI

Each device should support initialization,  put into a safe state and shutdown.

User should be able to turn on/off LED

User should be able to set LED intensity

User should be able to set position to stage ( position range from 1 to 10) [ for the purpose of the simulated application the move between each position can be set to 1sec].

User should be able to Home the stage

User should be able to run the following simple validation procedure:

Move stage to home

Move to each position with a delay between move of 1sec

LED should be turn On during each position move and off at end of each move

For each move LED intensity should be increase by 10% from the starting intensity

User should be able to cancel the validation procedure
